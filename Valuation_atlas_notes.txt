VA Notes

Notes for loading shapefile data for new borders (Starting after ~ Line 120):
 When not adding st_wrap_dateline, there are multiple artifact lines (probably because they cross the east/west margins of the map) 
 When adding st_wrap_dateline, the artifact lines are removed 
 but the borders at the margins of the map are open in some instances (e.g see eastern Russia, western Antarcica)

 Test here whether the outlines look good
